## üîß Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory** for data ingestion.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** for raw and transformed data storage.
- **Azure Databricks** for data transformation using Apache Spark.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for querying and analyzing data.
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## üöÄ Steps Implemented

### 1. Data Ingestion with Azure Data Factory

- Configured pipelines to copy raw data from Kaggle (GitHub raw CSVs) to Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- Created linked services for both HTTP sources and Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- Stored data in the `raw` folder within the Data Lake.



### 2. Data Transformation with Azure Databricks

- Mounted Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage to Databricks.
- Transformed datasets:
  - Changed data types (e.g., strings to integers).
  - Performed aggregations, groupings, and averages.
  - Partitioned and saved transformed data back to Data Lake Gen2.



### 3. Data Analysis with Synapse Analytics

- Created external tables in Synapse Analytics pointing to transformed data.
- Queried data using SQL scripts to extract meaningful insights.
- Used Synapse's inbuilt visualization tools for quick insights.



### 4. Visualization with Power BI

- Connected Power BI to Synapse Analytics using serverless SQL endpoints.
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize player performance, team statistics, and more.

## üèÜ Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers the entire data lifecycle from ingestion to visualization.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed using Azure‚Äôs scalable cloud services.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Insights displayed using Power BI dashboards.
