## 🌟 Project Architecture

```plaintext
Data Source (Kaggle) 
   ⇨ Data Ingestion (Data Factory) 
      ⇨ Raw Data Store (Data Lake Gen2) 
         ⇨ Transformation (Azure Databricks) 
            ⇨ Transformed Data (Data Lake Gen2) 
               ⇨ Analytics (Synapse Analytics) 
                  ⇨ Dashboard (Power BI)
```

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory** for data ingestion.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** for raw and transformed data storage.
- **Azure Databricks** for data transformation using Apache Spark.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for querying and analyzing data.
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Steps Implemented

### 1. Data Ingestion with Azure Data Factory

- Configured pipelines to copy raw data from Kaggle (GitHub raw CSVs) to Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- Created linked services for both HTTP sources and Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- Stored data in the `raw` folder within the Data Lake.



### 2. Data Transformation with Azure Databricks

- Mounted Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage to Databricks.
- Transformed datasets:
  - Changed data types (e.g., strings to integers).
  - Performed aggregations, groupings, and averages.
  - Partitioned and saved transformed data back to Data Lake Gen2.



### 3. Data Analysis with Synapse Analytics

- Created external tables in Synapse Analytics pointing to transformed data.
- Queried data using SQL scripts to extract meaningful insights.
- Used Synapse's inbuilt visualization tools for quick insights.



### 4. Visualization with Power BI

- Connected Power BI to Synapse Analytics using serverless SQL endpoints.
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize player performance, team statistics, and more.
